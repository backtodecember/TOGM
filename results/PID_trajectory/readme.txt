1: PID tracked trajectory by manual design, dt = 0.005, on origin now wrench space
2: PID tracked trajectory by manual design, dt = 0.005, on wrench space *2
3: Standstill trajectory from the simulated with joints fixed, dt = 0.05, 9s in total. Wrench space No.4
4: Standstill trajectory using diffne, tracked by PID controller at dt = 0.005. Wrench space No.4. 10s in total
5: Standstill trajectory using diffne, tracked by PID controller at dt = 0.001. Wrench space No.4. 10s in total
6: PID tracked trajectory by manual design using diffne, dt = 0.005. Wrench space No.4. 10s in total (1st second is settling.)
